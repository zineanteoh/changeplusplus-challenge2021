# Change++ 2021 Coding Challenge due 9/24 at 11:59 PM
## Before You Begin

Congrats!! You have been selected to engage in the next step of the Change++ application process. The next step in our process is completing the following coding project. As we are unable to offer interviews to every applicant, we will use this challenge to evaluate a number of criteria including technical skills and commitment to Change++. We expect this to take between 2-6 hours depending on experience level and technical skills. You will have approximately one week to complete the challenge. We recognize that you are all busy, but as a member of a Change++ team it is expected that you will dedicate 4-6 hours every week working on your project; therefore, we believe this is a reasonable timeframe.

## What we are looking for

At Change++, our project teams are made up of members ranging from those in their first-year at Vanderbilt to those in graduate programs. We know that you all have varying degrees of technical skills and experience, all of which we will take into account when reviewing your code. Working on a Change++ team, you may often use a new technology that you are not familiar with and have not learned in CS courses at Vanderbilt, but weâ€™re looking to see that you demonstrate the initiative and resourcefulness necessary to learn new skills and complete your work in a timely manner. You should be able to complete this challenge with a combination of basic programming skills (AP CS, 1101, 2201 etc.) and online resources.

As far as your code goes, here are a few high-level things we are looking for:
### Functionality
As always, the most important criteria is whether or not your code works according to the requirements. You should not only work to meet the requirements given, but also do your best to deliver a quality product, which may mean more than just completing the specification as stated.
### Good style and Readability
As this is an untimed challenge, we expect a certain level of quality. Be sure to comment and format your code as you might while working on an application for one of our non-profits. Keep in mind we will be reading and trying to understand your code. It is in your best interest to include intentional comments and meaningful commit messages.
### Organization and Extensibility
This goes along with good style. We want to see your ability to develop maintainable code. Although we will not actually build further upon this challenge, you should organize your work in an intuitive manner which would make it easy to build upon in the future. 
### Creativity
Change++ members are people who use creativity and initiative to get things done. There will likely be plenty of applicants who attempt this challenge, so it will benefit you to make your program stand out.


# The Challenge
Your task is to build a game which tests the user on their ability to rank the popularity of songs.

**Given 3 songs from the Top 100 songs on the Billboard, prompt the user to order the songs in terms of their position on the Billboard and let them know if they were correct. Once the user is finished, let the user know how accurate they were in their guesses.**

To do this we are going to be requiring you to build two different services, a frontend and a backend, which together complete the project.


## The Frontend
The frontend serves as the way that a user would interact with your program and play the game. You have a lot of flexibility in terms of how you choose to build it ranging from a simple executable (ran from the terminal) to a website, app, or any (reasonable) technology you can think of.



## The Backend
The backend consists of a RESTful API that can be accessed to retrieve song titles and artist names from the top 100 songs on the Billboard Charts with their order. Once again, there is a good amount of flexibility.


## Game Loop

The game loop for your application should look something like this:

<ol>
  <li>Before the game begins, manually start the backend server. This will probably look something like running a command ("python3 backend.py", "node server.js", "go run server.go", etc.)
  </li>
  <li>When user starts program (likely with a similar command in the terminal), call the backend to get songs from the Billboard Charts in order. After getting and storing this information in some data structure, using the backend will no longer be necessary.</li>
  <li>Randomly choose three (or more!) songs of which the user will guess the ranking </li>
  <li>Prompt the user to guess the order of the chosen songs</li>
  <li>Let the user know if they were correct</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 3-5 at least a few times</li>
  <li>Show the user their game statistics</li>
</ol>

Note: There is a good amount of room for creativity within the challenge. The game loop is just a suggestion.

<ul>
  <li>We may need additional information about reading or running your program</li>

## Tips, Tricks, and Helpful Resources

**If you have any general questions or want advice on how to get started/learn something, please email Berke Lunstad: berke.k.lunstad@vanderbilt.edu.**


<ul>
  <li>DO NOT TRY TO USE C++ FOR THIS PROJECT! We will be impressed if you manage to pull it off but it would also be really hard. Python or JavaScript are probably the easiest language to use to meet the base requirements and is not that hard to learn for someone who knows C++. Java is also doable, but might be slightly harder.</li>
  <li>We are trying to simulate "real world development" in this project so Google is definitely your friend. Be resourceful!! (Specifically, if you don't know where to start, you can google how to make an API in Python/JavaScript/etc)</li>
  <li>RESTful API
    <ul>
      <li>If you have never made an API before, it might seem fairly tricky. It is supposed to be a bit challenging, but definitely achievable and should not require a massive amount of code. There is a working solution of the backend written in less than 50 lines of code including WebScraping (note that it is totally ok if your solution is longer and a shorter solution is not necessarily a better solution, aim for clarity in your code).</li>
      <li>If you want to write an API, my first suggestion would be to google "how to write an API in {language of choice}". Follow a tutorial and copy paste some code and work with it until you generally understand what it is doing, then try to modify it to work for this project</li>
      <li>For a general explanation of what RESTful APIs are and how they work, check out this link: https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Git
    <ul>
      <li>If you have never used git before it might seem a little daunting but it is actually, for this project at least, fairly straightforward. If you have any specific issues with it, try google and if you still can't figure it out, email berke.k.lunstad@vanderbilt.edu for help</li>
      <li>If you want a basic tutorial on Git, check out this link: https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-fcffd87c15a3</li>
      <li>To get you on the right track, the only commands you should need to use for this are `git clone {repo}`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push`</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Here's some tips if you want to try your hand at webscraping
    <ul>
      <li>Here's an explanation of the DOM: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction
      <li>Here's an explanation of what Web Scraping is: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-scraping-and-how-to-use-it/</li>
      <li>Here's a link to a library that is super useful in parsing the DOM in python: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/. Similar libraries exist for Java and JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Good luck!</li>
